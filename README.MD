# justlog [![Build Status](https://github.com/gempir/justlog/workflows/ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gempir/justlog/actions?query=workflow%3Aci)

### What is this?
Justlog is an twitch irc bot. It focuses on logging and providing an api for the logs.

### Docker

```
mkdir logs # Make sure the log folder is set correctly in your config
docker run -p 8025:8025 --restart=unless-stopped -v $PWD/config.json:/etc/justlog.json -v $PWD/logs:/logs ghcr.io/gempir/justlog
```

By default, logs created by the container are owned by UID and GID 1000. If you want to customize that, you need to specify the UID and GID environment variables:

```
docker run -p 8025:8025 -e="UID=999" -e="GID=999" --restart=unless-stopped -v $PWD/config.json:/etc/justlog.json -v $PWD/logs:/logs ghcr.io/gempir/justlog
```


### Commands
- `!justlog status` will respond with uptime
- `!justlog join gempir,pajlada` will join the channels and append them to the config
- `!justlog optout gempir,gempbot` will opt out users of message logging or querying previous logs of that user, same applies to users own channel
- `!justlog optin gempir,gempbot` will revert the opt out

### Config

```
{
    "admins": ["gempir"], // will only respond to commands executed by these users
    "logsDirectory": "./logs", // the directory to log into
    "adminAPIKey": "noshot", // your secret api key to access the admin api (documented below)
    "username": "gempbot", // bot username (can be justinfan123123 if you don't want to use an account)
    "oauth": "oauthtokenforchat", // bot token can be anything if justinfan123123
    "botVerified": true, // increase ratelimits if you have a verified bot, so the bot can join faster, false by default
    "clientID": "mytwitchclientid", // your client ID, needed for fetching userids or usernames etc
    "clientSecret": "mysecret", // your twitch client secret
    "logLevel": "info", // the log level, keep this to info probably
    "channels": ["77829817", "11148817"], // the channels (userids) you want to log
    "archive": true // probably keep to true, will disable gzipping of old logs if false, useful if you setup compression on your own
}
```
